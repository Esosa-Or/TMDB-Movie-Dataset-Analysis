### Background of the Analysis:

This data set contains information of about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings, genres, release dates, revenue and so forth.

The primary dependent variable for this analysis is box office revenues, and the relationship between box office revenues and other factors like seasonality and genre will be explored in the course of this report.

### Research Questions:

Imagine, if you will, that you are a data analyst hired by Universal Pictures or any other big movie production company. Your job is to answer one basic question = What are the key determinants of high box office revenues?

To answer that question, you must explore other questions such as:

* What are the trends in key variables (run-time, number of movies over time etc)  and how have they changed over time?
* What does that tell us about the movie industry?
* Are revenues and profitability in the movie industry affected by seasonality?
* What are the most popular movie genres overall and how has that changed over time?
* What are the most profitable/highest grossing genres?

> From my analysis of the TMDB dataset, i found the following:

* Average movie length is decreasing. Production companies must therefore ensure that new releases are within the currently prevailing runtimes to avoid losing the interest/attention of moviegoers, with the attendant implications on revenue
* There is a seasonal component to box office revenues. Based on our analyis, the best month to release a movie would be some time in June, which is the start of summer.
* 3 movie genres have been consistently popular over time = Action, Adventure and Crime. It is recommended that the largest chunk of investments by film studios should be in these genres, as such popular genres are associated with higher popularity and greater box office numbers.
